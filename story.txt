This is my brother's story but it's a good one. He was working as a night porter at an old hotel from the 18th century in the Northern English countryside. One night, a woman came down to reception as white as a sheet with her suitcase saying she could not sleep and did not want to stay there. My brother enquired as to why, she said she could hear children laughing all night and a child had entered her room with a candle and was standing at the foot of the bed and wouldn't leave. My brother mentioned it to his manager the following morning and he was told that it is a regular occurrence - before the hotel was a hotel it used to be used as a school and kindergarten over 100 years ago.
