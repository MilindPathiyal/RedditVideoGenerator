Had a glass of champagne, nice chat. A good date overall. However, when the action had barely just begun he went into some sort of a trance touching himself all over. He looked like he was having sex with an entity. I stepped aside and observed with curiosity. He didn't even notice. When he came back from wherever he was I politely asked him to leave. Weirdest experience ever.
